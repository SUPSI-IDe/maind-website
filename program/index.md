## Designing Advanced Artifacts, Environments and Services

The Master of Advanced Studies (MAS) in Interaction Design combines design thinking, prototyping techniques, digital fabrication, programming, and physical computing in one study program addressing the realization of projects in which the interaction between the design culture and the technological development allows to generate design-driven innovations.

The program places Interaction design at the center of an original curriculum where it serves as the key element in the design of Advanced Artifacts, Environments, and Services.
The goal of the MAS is to train skilled professionals who play a key role within the most innovative industrial and design fields.

## Methods and Approaches

The MAS educational model focuses on methods and processes to generate innovations.
Students have the opportunity to acquire Human Centred Design methods for the analysis and the solution of design problems and to autonomously practice research methods.

A pragmatic problem-solving approach to design is applied in a laboratory environment. Peer to peer learning, iterative processes and the rapid prototyping of digital and physical solutions qualify the students to pursue careers in industry, research and design agencies, wherever technological innovation and design meet.

## Topics and Contents

The MAS courses are held by well-recognized lecturers and in collaboration with an established network of organizations, research centers, design practices and companies. 

Topics such as user experience design, service design, user interface design, open design, spatial design, and information visualization are taught through design-driven courses that allow students to develop digital ecosystems, IoT products, web and mobile applications, data visualization systems, interactive installations and exhibitions.

Courses held by interaction designers, computational designer and creative technologists allow the students to learn programming and physical computing, digital fabrication techniques, the use of web technologies and tools to deliver working prototypes.

The MAS gives to students the basic knowledge required to set up a business plan and sustain a pitch to investors in the event that they want to launch a startup.
