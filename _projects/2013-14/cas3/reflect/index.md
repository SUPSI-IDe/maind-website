Reflect is an interactive, architectural installation that is inspired by water, the most quintessential element of Hangzhou culture and tradition.
The notion of water is interpreted in the Hangzhou Cirque du Soleil theatre as two aquatic walls running full length on opposing sides of the lobby The aquatic effect is achieved using “waterfall printers”, a thin, falling surface of water that functions like a continuous-feed printer.
Visitors will observe the first water wall from street level as they approach the building. It is directly behind the glass facade of the building. This wall displays patterns related to the show as well as Chinese culture. Once they enter the building they will observe a second aquatic wall on the opposing side of the lobby. When they approach this second wall they will realize it is interactive, and that their gestures create effects on the surface of the waterfall.
Canals run across the borders of the lobby below the water walls and manage the return of the water. Just
before the start of the show, automatic bridges come out connecting the lobby and the theatre for people to walk across and take their seats.

User experience

The user interface is both simple and tacit. The waterfall printer in front of the lobby entices the audience walking in with a preview of waterfall printer displaying images related to the show and Chinese culture. All objects in front of the waterfall printer are reflected as a flowing image refreshing regularly. The gestures and movements of things in front of the printer are mirrored back to the users in a water flowing format with the splash sound when the water hits the floor.
Interface, interaction modularity

Reflect is an interactive water installation consisting of 2 waterfall printers. The waterfall printer in front of the lobby entices the audience walking in with a preview of waterfall printer displaying images related to the show and chinese culture.
The waterfall printer inside the lobby separating the lobby and the seating area acts as a flowing mirror reflecting people and material in front of the mirror. The user movements and gestures are captured and the shapes flow as waterdrops down from the waterfall printer.

The prototype is designed to provide users a sneak peak into the actual installation.
The architectural model displays where the waterfall printers are located in the actual space of the cirque. The piece in front illustrates an actual waterfall printer created by LEDs. The image is lighted in a format such that the light flows from the top to the bottom similar to a waterfall. Near the wall between the lobby and the seating area there are three slots for inserting the model of a girl. When the user inserts the model, a flowing reflection is created using LEDs.

The physical screen prototype has a screen on which a flowing reflection of users standing till 2m in front of it is reflected simulating the effect of water. When the reflection flows and touches the bottom of the screen a sound similar to water splashing plays in the background.
