The interactive installation uses 9 mirrors, to show the working of a DLP projector. Each mirror has an on and off position controlled by a button, which decides if the light will fall on the screen or not.
Each button also produces a musical note, when the mirror is in the on position.

Interface, interaction modality and user experience

Itâ€™s a light and sound installation, which involves the user (child) to interact with the control, to create light and sound.
The user (child) controls the positions of the mirrors and also creates music.
The control box has nine buttons for controlling the position of nine mirrors, and each producing a music note.
Depending on whether the mirror is on or off position, the child (user) can see light on the screen or not respectively. If there is light then the note that the particular button plays is selected. After selecting which notes the child wants, he can press the 10th button. The 10th button plays the selected notes in a loop.
The musical notes explain the idea of a change when the position of mirror changes.
Research and Development Context

The project context was to build a product/installation/demo for children below 13 helping them learn about digital concepts in a practical and simple way.
Also the product/installation/demo was to be made at a minimal cost to help small organizations like museums reproduce the same.
We choose to show the working of a projector, since that it something we see in many places in our day-to-day life, the cinema, school, institutions.
Although there are many kinds of projectors, the basic principle is the same. The particular projector we choose is the DLP projector, which has one mirror for each pixel in the image it projects.
