## Abstract

Will Power is a collective, voice driver, interactive audience experience that works in conjunction with onstage elements and lighting effects in the Cirque 2017 show. 


## Interface and interaction modality

The interface is a huge centrepiece that will provide a feedback of the audience cheering for WOZ’s revival. It will receive a voice feedback that could be displayed through light on the centre. It is a projection mapping experience for people to participate with voice as an input. 


## Technology
Projection mapping, Processing, After Effects, Arduino. 

## User experience

Will Power works by prompting people to stand and shout out a key phrase which is “Will Power” at a designated moment during the show. This works in conjunction with projection mapping effects that highlight and amplify the actions of the audience members. A chain reaction ensues as an increasing number of spectators stand and do the same. The projection mapping effects give the impression of light waves emanating from the audience towards the stage which would hold a centre-piece that shows the feedback. 

The effect on stage is that of a massive set piece that becomes increasingly illuminated as more and more people engage, seemingly powered by the will of the audience. This is intended as a metaphorical reconstitution of the main stage character’s true self. Woz finds his inner light through WILL POWER. 


## Research and development context

Involving people in the narrative was the first goal and we prototyped a display to show the direct impact of collaborative efforts to revive Woz’s light back to life. It is a gamification we would like to introduce to the Game Reality Show. After researching popular group centric activities performed by many researchers we decided to use Voice as the best input for the interaction model and people to directly make an impact on the events in the theatre. For the development phase, we would like to build a big scale model to display the interaction between people and the main character. 


## Hardware and electronics

A light placed in the centre of the stage designed with Arduino and a 3d printed sphere that would light up when an input is received that would be translated into light, showing their impact on the stage.
