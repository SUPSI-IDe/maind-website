Kano is a young company, with an eclectic group of creatives, coders, writers, thinkers and electrical geniuses working together towards a common passion - to create hardware and software for people of all ages to make and play with technology. This talk will aim to pick apart the attitudes, processes and the importance of play within our studio, our design approach and culture, telling the story of how a bunch of twenty-somethings hack, glue, solder, fail and experiment their way from an idea, to a product sold all around the world. 

With a focus on the excitement and growing pains of being a product designer in a start-up company, as well as shedding some light on the realities and learnings of manufacturing and scaling a Kickstarter hardware project, the talk will offer insight on what it takes to build, grow and reach the masses.  Expect stories of long nights, critical kids, guerrilla user testing and misbehaving circuit boards.
