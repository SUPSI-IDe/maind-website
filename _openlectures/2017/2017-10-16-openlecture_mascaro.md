## Fever Pitch
*Design the new mobile app of FC Internazionale Milano*

F.C. Internazionale Milano needed a new mobile app in its digital ecosystem that could become the clubâ€™s official voice in a scenario of a plurality of unofficial apps and websites owned by fans. We have proposed to the Club a solution focused on the supporters, their peculiar needs, their urgency to remain constantly up to date and the plurality of situations and context where they can live their passion for the Club. How we did it and what we have learned during the design process.
