## Keeping It Open, Or, Why Design Is Not What It Used To Be

### Description
Since the late 1990s, digital technologies and social media have reached a point of maturity from which a new industrial culture is emerging. This networked information economy is having a huge impact on the creative fields, transforming fundamental aspects of the processes of creation, mediation, distribution and consumption.
It is clearly more than technological change, however, that drives these ways of doing things: there is a strong cultural shift underpinning these practices.
