Master of Advanced studies in Interaction Design SUPSI is glad to invite you to the open lecture of Alok b. Nandi, creative director, UX strategist, interaction designer; president of IxDA - Interaction Design Association.

## Interactive narrative
Humans are storytelling creatures, making sense of their ever changing world through stories. From face to face encounters to narrative data, we see nowadays a vast continuum of modes for sharing knowledge through stories.
Creating narratives allow the connection of dots between different layers of experiences and
multiple levels of strategies, both in physical and digital scapes. The nature of narrative requires hands-on work, taking into account context and people.
We will focus on questions such as: how is the nature of narrative evolving? Interactive narrative, distributed narrative, data narrative, strategic narrative, … where are we?
Does interaction break narrative arcs? We will look into designing narrative, narratives of design, the tension between interactive and narrative.


## Alok b. Nandi
Leading design teams of publishing companies in Belgium and France (Casterman, the publisher of a.o. Tintin; groupe Flammarion), he then got involved in R&D programs to explore storytelling with technologies, AR & VR installations for museums and public places. In 2004, he launched Architempo to explore the multiple dimensions of design: from interaction design to exhibitions (red dot design museum, St-Etienne Design Biennale), interventions and conferences (chair of Interaction14 in Amsterdam). He launched PechaKucha Night in Brussels and is a regular speaker in international conferences.

Alok Nandi’s background combines electromechanical engineering, management and film studies.
International speaker and jury member (in design, new media, cinema and start-ups), he is professor at the Institut Paul Bocuse in Lyon, with hospitality/culinary professionals.
