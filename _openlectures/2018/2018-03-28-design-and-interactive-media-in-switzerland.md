Pro Helvetia is testing new promotion models in the areas of design and interactive media. Swiss talents in these domains are among the best in the world, not least thanks to outstanding courses offered at universities. As a rule, however, creatively minded graduates cannot move on to traditional institutions such as museums or theatres. Instead, they need to take their productions directly to the market.
New calls launched by Pro Helvetia, the Swiss Art Council, aim to support projects not only in view of their artistic quality, but also with an eye on their innovation and market potential.
