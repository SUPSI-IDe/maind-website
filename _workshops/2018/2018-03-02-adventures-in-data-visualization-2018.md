## Overview

Adventures in data visualization is a summer workshop dedicated to explorations into the field of data visualization by means of computational design approaches and technologies.
By accessing, creating and manipulating datasets, the participants design and develop projects that make raw data perceivable through digital or physical experiences. 

By leveraging web technologies for visualization, participants will focus on creating data-driven stories and concepts on one of the most hyped financial topic: cryptocurrency.

How many cryptocurrencies have been generated in the last few years? What is the average changes in the values every week? How many transactions happen every hours?
How much money disappeared in cryptocurrencies related scam? How many services are based on cryptos?

The projects can make use of storytelling, experimental, artistic or information design techniques and approaches. Data on cryptocurrencies is the material, D3js is the tool and the web is the medium.

The workshop activities are based on design and programming sessions in which participants develop a project individually or in teams. The workshop is an intensive educational course featuring hands-on activities and peer to peer learning.

During the workshop tutoring sessions and resources are provided according to the design goal of the participantsâ€™ projects. The tutoring sessions point to transfer the fundamental knowledge of web technologies, in particular, of popular software libraries such as D3.js, The main programming language of the workshop is javascript/D3js, but participants can choose a different prototyping platform or other web technologies depending on the goal of their project.


## Lake sessions

Evening dives into the lake of Lugano are a warmly encouraged side activity of the workshop. Participants are welcome to bring their own bath suit.
