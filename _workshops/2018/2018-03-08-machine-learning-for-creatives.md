## Overview

The workshop will take place from 29th June to 1st July 2018 at the Museum of Digital Art (MuDA), in Zurich.

The workshop provides an introduction to artificial intelligence and the relative creative applications. Participants will learn how to include AI in their projects, and to experiment with some simple tools created for artists and designers.

The initial part covers a high-level definition of what is artificial intelligence in general and machine learning in particular. Then we’ll look at existing projects that use this technology in the fields of art, science, design, and poetry.

In the second part of the workshop, participants will experiment using machine learning as a tool. We'll look at some existing web-based libraries, and many examples will be provided. 
Participants will be involved in the creation of new projects, starting from the ones provided, effectively experimenting first-hand in tweaking the data and algorithms. 
Some of the experiments will cover machine-generated poetry, style transfer between images, teaching machines how to recognize different objects, and more!
