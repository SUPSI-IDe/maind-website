## Overview

Adventures in data visualization is a summer workshop dedicated to explorations into the field of data visualization by means of computational technologies and design approaches. By accessing and manipulating open datasets, the participants design and develop projects that make raw data perceivable through digital or physical means, transforming them in interactive experiences or in narrative flows, that create open data in turn. The projects can be built upon the use of storytelling, experimental or artistic approaches, information design techniques: the adventures in data visualization can be many in the time frame of five days hands-on workshop.

The workshop activities are based on design, coding and making sessions where participants develop a project individually or in teams. There are no media constraints: the output can be a screen-based work, a projection-based installation or site-specific installation, a 3D printed or laser cut structure. The main programming language of the workshop is javascript/D3js, but participants can choose a different prototyping platform or other web technologies depending on the goal of their project.

The workshop is an intensive educational course featuring hands-on activities, peer to peer learning and tutoring sessions. During the workshop tutoring sessions and resources are provided according to the design goal of the participantsâ€™ projects. The tutoring sessions focus on and web technologies. People with advanced tech proficiency is free to use their favorite prototyping and development framework, and get support and collaboration on the design level.

### Open data
The 2016 edition of the workshop Adventures in data visualization aims to explore the field of Open Data. Participants will be introduced to the topic, obtain legal and technical grounding in open data, and access and manipulate on-line datasets to create their projects.
Participants will be introduced to the wealth of new resources for creative investigation and exploration, such as open government data portals and cloud-based data aggregation tools.

Lake sessions
Evening dives into the lake of Lugano are a warmly encouraged side activity of the workshop. Participants are warmly welcome to bring their own bath suit.

## Teachers and tutors

### Fabio Franchino
Fabio is a computational designer and a founding partner at ToDo. He has always been involved in creative processes, ranging in fields from music to design, passing through performing and generative arts. One day he discovered the potential of programming as a medium and unconventional tool for his creative purposes. He explores ideas through evolving processes, often finding unexpected, meaningful outcomes and new aesthetics. After gaining senior experience with ActionScript and Processing, recently he has been exploring JavaScript and web technology, trying to discover further creative potentials. He has taught in several institutions and has held workshops in his field of expertise; he also organized the first Italian event devoted to computational practices in art and design.
