From 12th to 16th December 2016, a group of designers, artists, researchers, students and makers gathered at Maind Interaction's Fablab  to realize prototypes of solutions that mediate, deconstruct and open - via other senses - the artworks of the museums of the Italian speaking Switzerland.

The action-research **[Senseable Art](http://www.mci.supsi.ch/senseable-art)** pointed at designing other codes for making cultural artifacts accessible, perceivable and understandable to all, both visually impaired and sighted people.

During the workshop, a series of guest speakers contributed to the discussion on the research topic: 
[Liviu Babitz from Cyborg](http://www.cyborgnest.net/) Nest presented the North Sense project and the latest. [Shintaro Miyazaki](https://www.ixdm.ch/) talked about his research on sonification at IXDM Lab in Basel; [Stefano Papetti](https://www.zhdk.ch/?person/detail&id=181595), researcher at ZHdK, showed his research projects on sonic interaction design, while [Thomas Amberg from Yaler](https://yaler.net/) and IoT Zurich helped us with some tinkering and prototyping.

Four projects and prototypes has been conceived in five days to explore the opportunities to mediate art via technologies and human senses. The projects are:
