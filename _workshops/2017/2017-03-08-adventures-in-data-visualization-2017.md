## Overview

Adventures in data visualization VR edition is a summer workshop dedicated to explorations into the field of data visualization by means of computational design approaches and technologies.

By accessing and manipulating open datasets, the participants design and develop projects that make raw data perceivable through virtual reality experiences. The workshop offers an opportunity to reimage common data experiences into virtually perceived worlds to create new and novel user experiences.

By leveraging VR technology, participants will focus on creating a deeper sensory connection between the user and the data by experimenting with data-driven stories.

The projects can make use of storytelling, experimental, artistic or information design techniques and approaches. Data is the material, VR is the medium.

The workshop activities are based on design and programming sessions in which participants develop a project individually or in teams.
The workshop is an intensive educational course featuring hands-on activities and peer to peer learning.

During the workshop tutoring sessions and resources are provided according to the design goal of the participantsâ€™ projects. 
The tutoring sessions point to transfer the fundamental knowledge of web technologies, in particular, of popular software libraries such as D3.js, Three.js and A-frame. People with advanced tech proficiency are free to use their favorite prototyping and development framework, and get support and collaboration on the design level.


## Open data

Adventures in data visualization VR edition focuses on the opportunities of leveraging the power of using Open Data for creative projects. Participants will be introduced to Open Data and its ecosystem of values and resources: OASI web, the platform of the Environmental Data Lab of Canton Ticino, will be used as one of the main repository of open datasets available for the development of the VR experiences.

## Lake sessions
Evening dives into the lake of Lugano are a warmly encouraged side activity of the workshop. Participants are welcome to bring their own bath suit.



## Teachers & Tutors

**Fabio Franchino, [@fabiofranchino](https://twitter.com/fabiofranchino)**  
Fabio is a computational designer and a founding partner at ToDo Creative Agency in Torino. He has always been involved in creative processes, ranging in fields from music to design, passing through performing and generative arts. He discovered the potential of programming as a medium and unconventional tool for his creative purposes. He explores ideas through evolving processes, often finding unexpected, meaningful outcomes and new aesthetics. After gaining senior experience with ActionScript and Processing, he has been exploring JavaScript and web technologies, trying to discover further creative potentials. He has taught in several institutions and has held workshops in his field of expertise; he also organized the first Italian event devoted to computational practices in art and design.
