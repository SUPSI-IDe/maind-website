> "émoi” is both a service and data representation interface. In utilising today’s digital systems (ie. e-commerce, ubiquitous computing, sentiment analysis algorithms), émoi attempts to create an edible gustatory and oral somatosensory representation of the user’s emotion that can support and enrich the already existent interpersonal communication that is carried out through the sharing and exchanging of chocolates as gifts. Such chocolate-sharing scenarios include, but are not limited to, special occasions, holidays and celebrations, expressions of affection, greetings, or condolences. émoi also attempts to explore new and unusual scenarios that emerge as a result within this context. émoi’s emotion representation language is based on psychological research into the human gustatory and oral somatosensory experience. As a result it attempts to communicate user sentiment using appropriately defined qualities of taste, texture, shape and colour through chocolate.
