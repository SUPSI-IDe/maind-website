Across Europe, a growing movement of people and projects is using digital technologies like open data, open hardware and crowdsourcing to address social challenges in new ways. We call this Digital Social Innovation (DSI). Until now, this movement has lacked a community hub where passionate innovators can find funding and support opportunities, event listings and stories of innovation.


That is why [Nesta](http://www.nesta.org.uk/) in collaboration with the [Waag Society](http://waag.org/nl) and SUPSI have set up [digitalsocial.eu](https://digitalsocial.eu/) to bring together the European DSI community.


The platform has been designed to:

* showcase the work and tag the organisations as part of networks dealing with Open Data, Open Design, Open Hardware and Open Knowledge.

* explore the DSI community and search organisations and projects to understand what else is going on in the world of DSI, who they need to be speaking to, and who might be a potential partner or collaborator.

* identify funding and support opportunities, along with DSI-related events, across Europe. They can also submit and promote their own event to the DSI community.

* learn about what is happening across Europe through case studies and blogs focusing on DSI pioneers and their projects, and current trends.



All of the data on the digitalsocial.eu platform is open and accessible, and all the source code behind the platform is available open-source on GitHub. The digitalsocial.eu platform is free to use.
