### More information about the exhibition GIT-COMMIT 
GIT-COMMIT, Casa Jasmina’s open-exhibition
A shared exhibition to reflect on the house of the future
Milano, Palazzo Clerici, 12th-17th April 2016

### What about the house of the future?
With this assumption, Genuino, the European brand of arduino.cc team, presents GIT-COMMIT.
GIT-COMMIT is an interactive exhibition that attempts to open a dialogue on ideas, expectations and critical issues about the “connected living” of the future.
GIT-COMMIT is present on the main floor of Palazzo Clerici and consists of a web interface which communicates with four small thermal printers.
Visitors are confronted with four questions on the future home via the web page, and each printer translates their responses in a continual flow chart.
To complete the exhibition, on the 14th and 15th of April students from the Masters in Interaction Design at SUPSI, Lugano – under the guidance of Studio Folder – will conduct a workshop to investigate feedback gathered previously from the printers.

GIT-COMMIT is produced by Genuino with the collaboration between Casa Jasmina , the connected and open source apartment of Genuino curated by Bruce Sterling, the Londonears collective of open design opendesk, the Master in Interaction Design of SUPSI of Lugano.
