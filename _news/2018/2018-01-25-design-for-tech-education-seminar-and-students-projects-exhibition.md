MAInD master is glad to invite you to the open seminar Design for Tech Education and the exhibition of the master students’ projects developed during the second module Designing Advanced artifacts.
The seminar and the exhibition take place on Thursday 25th January 2018 at Campus Trevano SUPSI.
Read below the program and the information about the two events.

## Design for Tech Education - Open seminar
New technologies are revolutionizing the world of pedagogy as well as the sector of innovation in the field of education. The miniaturization of sensors and actuators and the increase of the cloud computing power allow to experiment with the possibility to develop interactive devices, hardware kits, ludic objects and new kids of interfaces that help kids to learn the basics of electronics, programming, robotics, artificial intelligence, tridimensional design, etc.
What are the challenges in projects proposing the use of ludic and hands-on devices to support learning activities? What is the role of design in the novel practices related to the education in the STEAM sector (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math)?

 
The objective of the seminar is to present projects, researches and reflections on the design and development of interactive artifacts supporting STEAM education and the innovation in education.
